# Improved Shamanic Dance
*A mod for BG:EE, BG:SoD, BG2:EE, EET and IWD:EE to make the Shaman class more useful.*

## Overview
One of the most prominent features of the Shaman class is the Shamanic Dance. It allows the shaman to call forth an endless supply of spirits to fight for their cause. However, in the original version the shaman is practically disabled while the dance is performed. This mod makes an attempt to improve this ability by allowing the shaman to move at reduced speed while performing the dance.

**Available languages:** English, French, German, Italian, Polish


## Components

### Improved Shamanic Dance (main component)

This component allows Shamans to move at reduced speed while performing the dance to give them more tactical options against opponents. To counteract this improvement somewhat, spirits won't listen to any shamans anymore but their own master.


### Expanded Shamanic Dance for high level characters (requires main component)

This component expands the Shamanic Dance by unlocking another tier of spirits at level 24 and enabling the spirits to protect the shaman from normal weapons and low level spell effects while the dance is performed.


### Add spell "Shamanic Pact" (independent component)

This component adds the new level 6 spell "Shamanic Pact" to the shaman's spellbook. It allows the shaman to resurrect a target as a spirit after its death and control it for a limited amount of time.


### Apply Shamanic Dance improvements to Shaman kits (requires main component)

This component attempts to modify the Shamanic Dance of available Shaman kits to behave like the dance of the main class. It should be installed after all mods that are providing Shaman kits.


### Shaman-specific items for IWD:EE (requires IWD:EE)

IWD:EE currently lacks any shaman-specific items. This component tries to change this deficiency and scatters several items exclusively for shamans all over Icewind Dale and beyond. The list includes several artifacts that were originally created for BG:EE - Siege of Dragonspear as well as a couple of new items.
