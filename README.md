# Improved Shamanic Dance
*A mod for BG:EE, BG2:EE and EET to make the Shaman class more useful.*

## Overview
One of the most prominent features of the Shaman class is the Shamanic Dance. It allows the shaman to call forth 
an endless supply of spirits to fight for their cause. However, in the original version the shaman is 
practically disabled while the dance is performed. This mod makes an attempt to improve this ability by 
allowing the shaman to move at reduced speed while performing the dance to give him more tactical options against 
opponents. To counteract this improvement somewhat, spirits won't listen to any shamans anymore but their own master.
